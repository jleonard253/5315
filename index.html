      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker is a computer program that performs operating system virtualization. Docker uses containers to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications. The containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p>NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It was developed by Igor Sysoev to solve the problem web servers had servicing large numbers of connections. It was designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine allows you to run an operating system on your computer or laptop that acts like a full separate computer. The advantage of this is reduced need of additional machines and you can also run multiple operating systems from one machine. The virtual operating system is also helpful testing and developing software without actually having a second device. </p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean?</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service platform for software developers. To use DigitalOcean's Infrastructure as a Service environment, developers run a virtual machine that DigitalOcean calls a "droplet." DigitalOcean Droplets are flexible Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use.</p>
