      <h2>What is GIT?</h2>
      <p>Git is an open source version control system. It is used to store content mainly to store code. The version control tracks changes as code is added by multiple developers in parallel.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Version control system maintains historical code changes. This helps since the code can be changed by multiple developers in parallel and if there are issues previous versions can then be called upon.</p>

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) Local Repo 2) Remote Repo 3) How to use GIT in Team Project multiple developers work on the same project at the same time.</h2>
      <p>In a GIT project the local repo is on your machine used only by yourself. This local machine has all your codebase files and commit history. The remote repo is for indirect use, it is typically shared by a team. Team members push commits to the shared remote repo. When multiple developers work on the project at the same time team members pull and commit files to and from the remote repo. These files are typically worked on ahead of time on the individual team members local repo. This allows team members to work independently on their local repos and then share their work by pushing it to the remote repo. </p>
